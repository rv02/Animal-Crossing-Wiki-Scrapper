Hey, thanks for stopping by. I'm Emily and I love Animal Crossing. Feel free to message me if you want to talk games, edits, suggestions, etc. Check out my community page for more random personal information.

Growing up, I played a decent amount of the original Gamecube Animal Crossing, though I was too young to truly appreciate it. I got into Wild World when it came out, and I was a little better, but still wasn't into the nitty gritty of perfection, keeping positive relations with neighbors, etc. I played it a lot, but didn't connect well with the experience these games try to provide. Now I'm playing City Folk (which I haven't touched since about a month after it came out) and I'm absolutely loving it. I love coming on here and learning about the games, events, characters, and so on. It's just fun to have fun, both on the wiki and in the game.
