Dōbutsu no Mori (どうぶつの森 Animal Forest in English?), is the name of the first installment in the Animal Crossing series. It was released only in Japan for the Nintendo 64. The reason it was originally released as a Japan-exclusive game was because Nintendo was uncertain whether a worldwide release for the game was viable, due to it being text-heavy and containing Japanese references and holidays that were untranslatable at the time.[1] It was later remade for the GameCube in 2002, and released worldwide as Animal Crossing. This game is compatible with the Expansion Pak and is displayed in a higher resolution when it is used (640x480 as opposed to 320x240). Since 2010, a fully playable fan translation patch is in existence which ports dialog directly from the Nintendo GameCube release, but there are glitches with long blocks of text such as mail and the Bulletin Board being cut off suddenly.
