Tom Nook's store is the economic centerpiece of every player's town (with the exception of Re-Tail in New Leaf). The store is owned and operated by Tom Nook, the most important non-playable character in the series.

In Wild World, Tom Nook stocks items based in Groups (A, B or C). The player's town is designated a group, and items from that group are more likely to stock in the store. Items from other groups will stock as well, but less frequently. The only way to find out what group the player's town has been designated is for them to keep a tally of the number of items from each group. Item Groups do not exist in Animal Crossing or City Folk, items are available based on individual towns.

When the shop is about to upgrade, a message will be posted on the News Bulletin telling that on the next day, the shop will be closed for remodeling. Nook also sends the players a letter informing them that his shop will be closed that day.

The first stage of Tom Nook's store
Tom Nook's store made its first appearance outside of Japan in the Nintendo GameCube Animal Crossing, as did many of the items sold at his store. The store was randomly located on the map of each town, but, like the Post Office, could only be found in the 'A' acres. The store offered furniture, clothing, tools, flowers, tree saplings, carpet, wallpaper, paint, and sign boards in exchange for Bells, the currency of the Animal Crossing world.

At the beginning of each game, the player will have a part-time job at Nook's Cranny, to help pay off their mortgage. This will involve making deliveries, writing letters, and meeting the residents of the town. While working for Nook, he gives a Uniform. This outfit is rare and it cannot be obtained from anywhere else.

After finishing the tutorial part-time work, the player is able to sell various items to Tom Nook in exchange for Bells. In many respects, these transactions form the core of the game experience.

Wild World also featured Nook's store randomly placed, but as the acre system was discarded for this title, the store may be located anywhere in the town. Furthermore, it will always be accompanied by Mable and Sable's clothes shop directly to the east.

Several minor changes were made for this title. The sign board item is no longer offered, though other tools have been added. Nook also does not sell clothing in this title, except via catalog; one must purchase shirts and other accessories next door from the Able Sisters. The Tom Nook Point System is introduced to allow for eventual discounts on all purchases, with occasional Point Special days awarding five times the points, and Spotlight Items will infrequently appear in store.

Shampoodle was also featured in the lower floor of Nook's store in Wild World, operated by Harriet as a hairdresser in the Nookington's upgrade. Upgrading to Nookington's triggers Tom Nook's episodes.

While the store is once again located randomly, it is no longer tied to the Able Sister's shop. Store hours for the Nook 'N' Go upgrade were changed, with the store now remaining open until 1 am. Tom Nook's Point System was revised to include a gift exchange feature, so that points can be exchanged for rare items. The Shampoodle was moved from Nook's to the city in this title.

Interestingly, this title also features the thus-far unique ability to have Nook downgrade his store. Thirty days after the player obtains Nookington's, as they are exiting the store, Nook will ask if the player favors good hours, a balance, or variety. The player's response will cause him to downgrade to Nook 'n' Go, Nookway, or keep Nookington's, respectively. Any change, if requested, will happen a week later. If the store has been downgraded, Tom Nook will eventually survey the player again.

The suggestions and answers are:

In New Leaf, Timmy and Tommy now run Tom Nook's old shop, while Tom Nook has taken a new living and runs a home improvement store named Nook's Homes, alongside with Lyle. Tommy runs the shop on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. Timmy runs the shop on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Shampoodle's salon is not inside the shop in this title, as it would open up above Able Sisters in Main Street. However, once the store gets its first upgrade into T&T Mart (which is very similar to Nook's Cranny), Tommy will run the store in the morning and Timmy will work the night shift, similar to how Pelly and Phyllis run the Post Office. Each time the Player expands the stores, both Timmy and Tommy will be seen and work more frequently.

In New Horizons, Nook's Cranny is run by Timmy and Tommy. Initially, it starts off as part of the Resident Services tent, since there is no physical store on the player's island yet until sufficient crafting items are given to Timmy. Once fulfilled, he will allow construction of Nook's Cranny, the location decided mostly by the player. Nook's Cranny has one upgrade, which increases the amount of stock and variety of items.

These are the special features that Tom Nook's Store can provide.

A noteworthy item that Nook will buy is the turnip, an item that may be purchased by the player from Joan on Sunday mornings between 6:00 AM and noon. This particular transaction is notable because the price Nook will pay varies from day to day, forcing the player to follow the Stalk Market.

In New Leaf, the task of purchasing turnips was handed on to Reese, owner of Re-Tail. Joan still has the job of selling the turnips to the player.

Aside from selling items in the store, Nook also gives the player access to their own personalized catalog, from which the player can order any item that they have held in their pockets. Anything that was ever held there will be featured, but rare items, fossils, fish, etc. cannot be ordered. When purchased, an item will arrive by mail in about five hours. Only five items may be ordered at a time between mailings.

Tom Nook holding a Monthly Raffle at Nook 'N' Go.
Exclusive to Animal Crossing, Nook offers a raffle for three rare items on the last day of every month. One entry for a chance to win requires five raffle tickets. Tickets are given to the player by Nook during the month after the purchase of an item in the store (not for items ordered through the catalog). The tickets are only good for the month they are labeled for but can be used in the future if saved. Nook will only give out raffle tickets for purchasing certain items. Items that are worth a raffle ticket are clothes, umbrellas, furniture, wallpaper, and carpet. Nook takes five raffle tickets, rolls the tumbler and lets out a colored ball. White balls are not winners. Green wins the third prize, red the second and gold wins the first prize.

The Tom Nook Point System machine.
When buying items in the store in Wild World and City Folk, Players are awarded Nook Points. For every 100 Bells spent, the Player earns 1 Nook Point. However, this is not cumulative: i.e. buying a pack of seeds at 80 Bells gives zero Nook Points, buying a second pack for a total of 160 Bells will still give zero Nook Points since they were purchased separately.

Nook Points serve to reward players for shopping at Nook's, offering discounts and prizes for their loyalty.

The easiest method for accumulating points would be on the Point Special. In this event, which is announced on the Bulletin Board, any item will award five times the normal point value. A normal purchase of an item at 100 Bells will now give the player five points during these days. Items ordered from the catalog will work as well. During these times, a moon will give the player 1,600 points and spending 400,000 Bells would unlock the Platinum membership. Normally, this amount would not be enough for Silver membership.

Nook's Cranny is the first incarnation of Tom Nook's Store. Open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., the player begins the game with this store.

In City Folk, Nook's store is laid out with shelving on the left wall, supporting one wallpaper (changes daily), some flooring (changes Daily), a flower seed or sapling, medicine, and some writing paper. Two pieces of furniture stand alone in front of the store. Three tools are set up on a table in the center of the room, which usually are a combination of Nets, Fishing Rods, Shovels, and Watering Cans. At the end of the shelving on the left is Nook's Point Tracking System. The bottom-right of the store resembles the cashier, and is one of the trademark features that all of Nook's Stores have.

'Nook's Cranny' is a parody of 'nook and cranny', meaning a small corner or hole. The store itself resembles a shed, made with wooden planks and held together with metal sheets. In fact, it is even stated that Tom Nook's shop may be Tortimer's old gardening shed before he became mayor. It is the only one of Nook's shops without an automatic door, as its Animal Crossing version had no door at all.

The player must spend and/or sell a total of 25,000 Bells and play for at least eight days for an upgrade.

After earning a Bronze membership at Nook's Point Tracking System, a model of Nook's Cranny is obtained.

The mat inside Nook 'n' Go
Nook 'N' Go is the second of Tom Nook's shops in the Animal Crossing series . For Tom Nook to expand to this shop, the player will need to buy/sell 25,000 Bells worth of stock at Nook's Cranny and play the game for at least 8 days. It is the only shop that has a sign pole. This shop is also the one that is open latest, and earliest (from 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM) in Animal Crossing and from 7:00 AM to 1:00 AM in City Folk. In Wild World, the store opens and closes at the same time as the other stores. Nook 'N' Go also appears in Wild World and City Folk.

To upgrade to Nookway in City Folk, the player must buy/sell a total of 80,000 bells and the store must be Nook 'n' Go for at least fifteen days. To upgrade to Nookway in the other versions, the player must only buy/sell 65,000 bells worth of stock at Nook 'N' Go.

https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/File:ACCF_Nookington%27s.ogg



The mat inside Nookington's
Nookington's is the largest expansion for Tom Nook's shop. In this expansion a whole new floor is opened up where furniture, wallpaper, and flooring is sold. Also, on the top floor Timmy and Tommy replace Tom Nook. In Wild World, after Tom Nook expands into Nookington's, the Shampoodle will also move into it to provide hairstyle makeovers for players at the cost of 3,000 Bells. To get Tom Nook to expand into Nookington's, the player must spend 240,000 bells and have a friend shop at the store. This shop has an automatic door. In City Folk, the player does not need a friend to shop at Nookway, and the upgrade cost has been reduced to 150,000.

To upgrade to Nookington's in Wild World, the player must spend 240,000 Bells at Nookway and a friend must buy something in the player's town as well. This creates problems for those who do not have a friend that they can connect with, and further problems if players do not have a sufficient internet connection using the built-in Wi-Fi using the DS (to connect to the internet) or Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector (that connects the DS or Wii to the internet using the computer) - they will be unable to upgrade. There is no other way to get Nookington's, though the problem can be solved by exchanging friend codes with another player over the internet. However, some Wild World game cards may have a glitch and will upgrade from Nookway to Nookington's whether a visitor shopped at the store or not. Online forums concerning the game will generally feature several people looking to travel and make new friends, with a dangerous risk. However, as of May 20th, 2014, Nintendo has officially stopped Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for the Wii and DS, making visiting towns over the internet and upgrading to Nookington's very hard if you do not have a friend nearby with a copy of Wild World. The Wii U's Virtual Console version of Wild World, however, allows the player to upgrade to Nookington's without the need of a friend visiting their town and buying something from Nookway.
