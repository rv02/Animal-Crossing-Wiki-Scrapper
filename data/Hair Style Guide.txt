A player after having their haircut in City Folk
In Wild World, City Folk and New Leaf, the player can change their character's hairstyle by visiting Harriet at Shampoodle. The style and color is determined through a series of questions. When getting a haircut or makeover, Harriet will push a button, and a large, hairdryer looking device will cover the player's entire head. After a few seconds, it pops off. The player will always have a shocked look on their face when the action is complete.

The player must change the hairstyle 16 times to unlock the haircuts of the opposite gender. After that Harriet will ask the player if they are interested in the opposite gender's haircut before asking the questions.

The player must get 14 haircuts of their gender.

The player needs to get their hair cut 15 times in order to unlock the option to get a haircut that is classified as the "opposite gender" that the player entered when they first began the game. It is not necessary to get every single different style in order to unlock opposite gender haircuts.
