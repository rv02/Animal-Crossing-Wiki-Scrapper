The paper kite butterfly (オオゴマダラ, Oogomadara?) is a bug that first appeared in New Horizons. It can be found flying around the island from mid-morning until the evening year-round.

When either donating to the museum or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say (with abhorrence):

"With its black-and-white-striped wing pattern, the paper kite butterfly is both elegant and pretty... PRETTY POISONOUS I MEAN! Hoo dear! Where was I? Oh yes... Even this butterfly's black-and-white-striped larva and little golden pupae are toxic to predators. Indeed, the paper kite butterfly's foul flavor is famous, and thus birds, in particular, steer clear of the fiends. THIS bird most of all!"

Once donated, the paper kite butterfly can be found in the laboratory, having emerged from a cocoon.





Idea leuconoe, the paper kite, rice paper or large tree nymph, is known especially for its presence in butterfly houses and live butterfly expositions. It has a wingspan of 12 to 14 cm. The paper kite is of Southeast Asian origin, but can also be found in Northern Australia and Southern Taiwan.

Larvae feed on ''Parsonsia'' species, ''Tylophora hispida'', ''Parsonsia helicandra'', ''Parsonsia spiralis'', and ''Cynanchum formosanum'' so both the butterfly and larva are poisonous. The paper kite butterfly's forewings and hindwings are translucent silvery white with black spots, similar to the ''Idea lynceus''.
