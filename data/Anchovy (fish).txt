The anchovy, is a fairly uncommon fish introduced in New Horizons. It can be found in the ocean year-round between the hours of 4am and 9pm.



Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"There are more than 140 species of anchovy, but they do all have some things in common. They are small and feed by simply swimming with their mouths open to filter food particles from the sea. (In my sleepier moments, I sometimes wish I could do that...)"

They can be found in the large ocean tank where the blue marlin and tuna also reside, where a large school of them will be creating a spiral in the center of the exhibit.





The anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) is a small, common forage fish of the family Engraulidae. Most species are found in marine waters, but several will enter brackish water and some in South America are restricted to freshwater. More than 140 species are placed in 17 genera; they are found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, and in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Anchovies are usually classified as oily fish.
