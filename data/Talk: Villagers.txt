A few villagers are missing from here (such as Chico and Peanut) and I can't edit the list...anyone know how to fix that?

First I suggest you create an account, as it is easier to track your edits and yackity yack yack. To add villagers, you go to their page and at the bottom is should say Categories. Then type in Villagers, enter, and save. Hope that's easy enough! G-Bot 01:21, February 6, 2012 (UTC) 

Okay. I'll do that. Oh yeah, they forgot Derwin too. I'll add him.

Sorry for another question but I was wondering on villager pages, for quite a few I see a smaller image of the villager next to the Appearances Heading. I was wondering whether this was needed or it should be deleted off all the villager's pages? Thanks in advance.
