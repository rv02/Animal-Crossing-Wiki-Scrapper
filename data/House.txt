The house is the player's home, and thus is the most customizable and personal part of the town, where they can display furniture and collectables, receive mail, and spend time with villagers who visit.  In all games, the house is where the player begins their day, and in many games is where the player can or must save and quit the game. At the beginning of each game (City Folk and before), the player purchases their new home from Tom Nook through a mortgage plan. In New Leaf and New Horizons, the player will start off with a tent. Paying off the mortgage allows you to expand your house.

The house first appeared in Animal Crossing as part of the Town Square. The town square includes four houses so that four players can live in the same town on one memory card.

The house can be furnished with different types of items. The carpet and wallpaper can be changed out at will, and a custom pattern can be installed on the floor or the wall. The house is expected to be well-furnished by the Happy Room Academy; players are encouraged to collect whole sets, series, and themes of furniture to get a higher score, and possibly the model room at the HRA.

If a player does not play their Animal Crossing series game for some time, they will return to find their house infested with cockroaches. Cockroaches will hide under furniture until it is replaced or moved and then will run all over the floor. The only way the player can get rid of cockroaches is by stepping on them, as opposed to using a net - like when outside, since the player cannot use nets indoors. In New Leaf, cockroaches will not appear if the town has the ordinance Keep Town Beautiful in effect, no matter how long the player has been away.

Directly outside the front door is the mailbox, where the player can receive mail from other villages or local players. In New Horizons, after the house has been fully expanded, the mailbox becomes a moveable object that the player can place as desired.

In Animal Forest, players are not able to get a second floor or basement.

Tent: In New Leaf and New Horizons, the player begins with a tent. It is nearly exactly the same as the house that cannot be expanded, with a mailbox and windows, except the light switch is not available and the wallpaper and flooring cannot be changed. In New Leaf, this restriction cannot be circumvented with Saharah, and such, she will refuse to redecorate the tent. Once the player pays Tom Nook the house down payment in New Leaf, the initial house will be built. In New Horizons, the player must pay off the Deserted Island Getaway Package with Nook Miles to upgrade to a house.

Main Room: This is the first room the house will start with. If the player's house is not a tent, this room can be upgraded several times, have its wallpaper and flooring changed, and in general is the largest room of all expansions.

Second Floor: Introduced in the original Animal Crossing, the second floor is a small room above the main floor, akin to an upstairs bedroom. This room can be furnished in the same way as the main floor.

Basement: Found in all versions but Wild World. The basement was not ranked by the HRA nor could it have its wallpaper or flooring changed until City Folk. In Animal Crossing, it serves mainly as a storage area, due to the lack of the universal storage system introduced in Wild World.

Side Additions: These three rooms are found in Wild World, New Leaf, and New Horizons. They are on the ground floor and can be accessed from the main room using doorways on the west, north, and east side of the room.

Attic: In Wild World and City Folk, the initial house also featured an attic. It is always at the top of the staircase. This means initially, it is on the second floor. When the second-floor expansion is purchased, the attic is raised to the third floor. It has the bed, where the player sleeps to save their game, and the Telephone, where the player can change the options of the game. Beds can be changed by the player, while the floor and wallpaper of the attic cannot be changed and no other furniture can be placed in the room.

The location of the player's home varies from game to game, and in some cases features more exterior amenities than other installments. 

The house exterior in Animal Crossing has some notable exterior flourishes compared to other versions. A sentient object, called a gyroid, sits outside the door. The gyroid can store objects to sell or give away to other players as well as being responsible for saving the game. If the player does not save the game through their gyroid, they will have to deal with Mr. Resetti when they sign in next. The front door can be embellished with a pattern. If the player has caught all 40 fish or insects, a weathervane or butterfly ornament, respectively, will be added to the exterior of the house. A mailbox is present outside the door opposite of the gyroid.

As for exterior styling of the house itself, while the structure cannot be modified the user can paint their roof in 3 ways: house expansion (excluding basement addition), buying paint cans from Nook, or helping Wisp.

Animal villagers can also change the color of the player's roof.

The player's house is always located below the Train Station acre in the town square, which hosts up to 4 players.

Unlike in the previous installment; Wild World features one house that all players share. However, the house later expands into much larger dimensions than the previous games. The mailbox is shared by the players living in the house, but the player can only take out their own mail. 

Gyroids are no longer present and have been replaced with an attic. The attic exists in the initial house, furniture cannot be placed in it apart from the beds it comes with, and it only exists as a place for players to "sleep" while they are not playing their character. Similar to the previous title, if the player does not save the game by sleeping in the Attic or using their START button to end the game, Mr. Resetti will visit the player upon their next sign in.

Exterior Styling of the house in Wild World saw the removal of the weathervane and butterfly ornament decorations, as well as the removal of Wisp, which limits the player's ability to customize the outside of their home compared to the previous titles. The player can purchase paint from Tom Nook following the first Store Upgrade, and the player will be given the opportunity to change their roof color upon each expansion upgrade.

The house is placed in a random location in the players' town, as determined when the town is first created upon starting the game for the first time.

City Folk saw the return of houses for each player in the village. The game continues the tradition started by Wild World of having an Attic be the main way of saving the game, apart from the + button.

Exterior Styling of the house remained the same from Wild World with two minor changes. The reintroduction of Wisp saw an additional way to paint the roof of the home outside of visiting Tom Nook after a completed Expansion Payment or buying a paint can following the first Store Upgrade. Finally, following the final upgrade, the player will be given a Flag by Tom Nook to fly outside their house which is fully customizable via the Attic phone.

Each player house is placed in a random location, and the player will be tasked with choosing a home by visiting each one, then talking to Tom Nook once they exit.

In a departure from the Wild World formula, the player must go visit Tom Nook to arrange the construction of their home upon first arriving. Nook follows the player around until the player decides on a construction site. Nook will show the player a preview of their completed home and the player is asked for confirmation. 

As the construction cannot be performed in one day, Tom Nook lends the player a tent to sleep in at the appointed location of the construction site. 

The player may also purchase exterior renovations for their house including paving, siding, fence, door, and mailbox for maximum customization. These are separate from expansions and can be purchased from Nook's Homes. However, as previously mentioned, exterior renovations cannot be applied while expansions are underway, and vice versa. 

New Leaf also sees the removal of Mr. Resetti visiting the player if the game is not reset. However, the character does make an appearance after the Reset Center Town Improvement is completed. Mr. Resetti will make one token appearance following the first time the player forgets to save, telling the player of how their Reset Center is no more.

Shortly after arriving at the Deserted Island in New Horizons, the player is given a tent that they can place almost anywhere on the initial portion of the island that can be accessed, including beaches. The player can imagine a preview of the tent before confirming the location. After Resident Services is upgraded from a tent to a building, Tom Nook will allow the player to move the location of their home once per day for a fee of 30,000 Bells.

Early on, the only part of the house's exterior that can be customized is the roof's color, and only when certain house upgrades are contracted. Eventually, the player can also customize the roof's material, the house's exterior, the door, and the mailbox for a fee. Exteriors can be renovated once per day. After all house upgrades and their associated loans have been paid off, Tom Nook will offer free exterior renovations for life.

The Interior of the house is fully customizable by the player, with the exception of the Basement in Animal Crossing.

The lights inside are controlled independently of the furniture in Animal Crossing by pressing the 'Z' button. The storage space was dependent on the number of storage furniture units one had in the house. Each storage unit, such as a bureau, dresser, or cabinet, could hold three items.

Unlike Animal Crossing, Wild World lighting is controlled by the individual lamps that the player places in the house, allowing some rooms to be illuminated while others remain dark.

Wild World also introduced the Unified Storage System, which links all storage units together with common inventory space, holding up to 90 items. The house also lacks a Basement floor, which makes all rooms in the house fully customizable by the player.

The Attic, also introduced in Wild World, is not customizable by the player outside of allowing the player to change their bed style by using a bed collected by the player and swapping them in their inventory. It is also noted that if the player does not play for a long period of time, the player's hairstyle will be changed to "Bedhead"

City Folk's lighting system is similar to Wild World's, in that the lighting in the house is controlled by the individual lamps in the home. City Folk also sees the return of the unified storage system, which has been expanded to 160 items as well as the Attic for each player house. All rooms are customizable by the player with the exception of the Attic.

New Leaf saw a return to the original method of Lighting control, introducing a universal light switch button on the Touch Screen that controls the lights in the house. The Unified Storage System has been expanded to 180 item capacity and can be readily accessed by the Train Station locker before the player has any storage units in their home. 

New Leaf also saw the introduction of a fully 360-degree camera in the home as well as walls being used to hang decoration and furniture. 

The Attic was removed in this version, making the START button on the 3DS system the only way the game can be saved by the player, as well as making all rooms customizable by the player.

In New Horizons, the furniture arrangement system seen in Happy Home Designer is implemented, allowing the player to decorate their houses with considerably more ease. Houses also have their own storage, which increases in size as the house is expanded to a maximum of 2,400 units.

For the first time, the basement and second floor expansions have a new dimension: a 6x10 rectangle.

In the absence of an attic, the game saves automatically every three minutes and when performing local and online multiplayer activities. The player can manually save and exit the game at any time by pressing the Minus (-) button.

Artwork  of a house.
In Animal Crossing the house expansion process is paid for by the player to Tom Nook through the Post Office. Upon picking the player's house at the start of the game from the Town Square, Tom Nook will inform the player of the first amount the player must pay back to them. 

Each segment of the house expansion process begins immediately after the player talks to Tom Nook following the payment of the previous Expansion's debt.

The four trophies in Animal Forest.
After the player's house has been fully upgraded and fully paid off, the player will receive a statue in front of the train station. The first player to do so of the four players will get a gold statue, the second player will get a silver statue, the third player will get a bronze statue, and the fourth will get a jade statue. This feature only appears in Animal Crossing. In Dōbutsu no Mori e+, the player will also receive their own private island.

Similar to its predecessor, Animal Crossing: Wild World has the player paying Tom Nook for expansions through the Post Office. However, the debt is shared by all players whom live in the house and rather than paying directly to Pelly or Phyllis the player instead pays towards their debt to an ABD machine in the corner of the Post Office.

After paying off the remainder of the previous expansion debt, speaking to Tom Nook will initiate the next expansion. Wild World was the first game in the series to introduce additional rooms on the ground floor, but also lacked any option to choose to start one expansion over another. All Expansions happen in linear order.

Following the end of the last expansion, no reward is granted to the player; unlike previous titles which granted a tangible reward.

City Folk sees no departure from the formula established in Wild World; however, the concept of additional ground floor rooms is removed and replaced with a revival of the basement floor, which is now fully customizable, unlike its predecessors that featured Basement floors.

City Folk also sees the return of a reward upon completing the final debt payment, receiving a flag outside their house as a free gift from Tom Nook. The design can be changed by calling Rover from the attic using the phone and selecting "Flag Design" from the menu.

Like previous games, each new expansion begins after paying off the previous debt by talking to Tom Nook.

Unlike in previous games, expansions must be initiated by the player first. After the Tent is established, the player must return to Tom Nook in order to begin expanding into the Initial House.

The Initial House features a down payment of 10,000 bells must be paid in full directly to Tom Nook before any construction can begin. The 10,000 bells must be paid all at once, directly to Tom Nook, instead of at the Post Office like later payments. Once the home is built, the player will be tasked to pay off the reminder of the debt owed to Tom Nook, which in total has the player paying about 39,800 bells for the expansion.

The Welcome Amiibo update introduced a secret storeroom, which can be purchased from Nook's Homes. This new feature provides a large amount of additional storage space (360 units) which can be accessed from anywhere within the player's home (but not from storage lockers). After a secret storeroom has been purchased, furniture can be arranged using the touch screen as seen in Happy Home Designer. The "room" is an additional button found next to the light switch on the touch screen. It can be added to the house once the initial second floor expansion is paid off. The total cost of the secret storeroom expansion is 158,000 Bells.

Unlike previous games, after repaying the debt to Tom Nook, players are not forced to immediately upgrade. This is because external renovations and house expansions cannot be performed simultaneously, so the player is given the choice to decide which they wish to be completed first.

In New Horizons, the house begins with the main room, which is expanded once from 6x6 to 8x8 (not including the upgrade from the tent, which was 4x4), and progresses to the rear room (6x6), the left room (6x6), the right room (6x6), the second floor (6x10), and the basement (6x10). All rooms, except the main room, are fixed in size and cannot be upgraded.

After all rooms have been constructed, Tom Nook will then offer four expansions to the house's storage, which increases its max capacity from 1,600 units up to a grand total of 5,000 units. Unlike previous upgrades, the storage expansion is not covered by a loan, and these payments must be paid in full to Tom Nook at Resident Services before he commences construction.
