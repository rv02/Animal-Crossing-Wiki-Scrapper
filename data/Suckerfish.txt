The suckerfish also known as remoras, are fish introduced in New Horizons that unusually have a fin. Due to this, many players mistake them for more lucrative finned fish, such as great white sharks or whale sharks. However, unlike these fish, the suckerfish has the distinction of being the only fish with a medium-sized shadow that also has a fin.



Upon donation to the museum in New Horizons, Blathers will say:

"The suckerfish is a curious fish that likes to attach itself with its sucker mouth to larger marine animals. The benefit to the suckerfish is that it gets to eat smaller parasites and dead skin off the host's body. Amusingly, some people have used suckerfish on cords to catch large turtles with the fish's own suction! I imagine this practice is the cause of some awkward conversations between fish and turtle, eh wot?"





Also known as remoras & sharksuckers.
Also known as the remora and sharksucker, the suckerfish (Remora remora) has a modified dorsal fin which it may use like a suction cup, creating a vacuum seal on larger marine creatures such as sharks and whales. They receive food and transportation from their hosts.
