The Nintendo 64 (N64 for short), codename Project Reality and Nintendo Ultra 64, is a home video game console made by Nintendo, released in 1996 in the United States, Japan, and Europe. Animal Forest was originally released only in Japan for the Nintendo 64 in 2001 months before Animal Forest+ was released on the Nintendo GameCube. The console revolutionized gaming with three-dimensional games. The Nintendo 64 uses Silicon Graphics (SGI) and MIPS Technologies, who were responsible for the R4300i microprocessor and the 3D graphics hardware used in the N64. The N64 was discontinued on November 30, 2003.

The Controller Pak is an accessory for the Nintendo 64 that plugs into the back of the console's controller and serves as a memory card. In addition, various games require the Controller Pak for saving, including Doubutsu no Mori, making it the only Nintendo-developed Nintendo 64 game to require the accessory for saving. Additionally, the Controller Pak is used to travel to other towns. Some copies of Doubutsu no Mori included a Controller Pak, which contains a letter from Shigeru Miyamoto and Grab Bag featuring two Famicom games and a K.K. Slider song.
