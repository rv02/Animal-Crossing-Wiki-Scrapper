User:Wrecks

N/A

Well hi, I'm Wrecks, previously known as Q Cumba FX but I'm starting to migrate over to this new account because I'm going to see about making a wiki for Solia Online, and my username is Wrecks on there so it'd be confusing if I had a different username on Wikia @___@ I assure you I'll still be working just as hard on here as before, I need to get my Wikia edit count up to 2,000-odd on here now! xD

I'm a 16 year old girl from the UK. Recently got addicted to Wild World again. xD

I'm a sysop on The Gaiapedia (with alternative account I mentioned up there, maybe I'll fully migrate onto this account though) so I thought I'd help out here. I shall do my best :3

My AC:WW info iiiiis:

Contact me if you wanna wi-fi sometime :3 Yes, I'm the nutter who runs around with a blue mohawk and a gas mask. 8D
