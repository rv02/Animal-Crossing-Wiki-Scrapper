Crafting

N/A

DIY recipes are a crafting mechanic in New Horizons. Recipes can be crafted at a DIY workbench using gathered materials and/or furniture. It can be accessed through the DIY Recipes app on the NookPhone. DIY recipes can be sold to Timmy and Tommy for 200 . At Nook's Cranny (and in the Resident Services tent), a few recipes are available for purchase, including the flimsy tools (Axe, Shovel, Fishing Rod, Net, and Watering Can), the slingshot, ladder, and vaulting pole.

Every day, 1 message in a bottle will wash up on the shore of the player's island, with a letter and a DIY recipe inside. If they do not pick up the bottle one day, two may spawn on the next. The bottle only contains DIY recipes otherwise obtainable from either all island residents or island residents of certain personalities. If the player goes to another island with a different season, the seasonal recipes change (e.g., If the player's island season is Summer, and they go to a Winter island, the seasonal recipes change from Summer recipes to Winter recipes).

These DIYs may only be constructed once during the main story. These DIYs have cards that can only be accessed via hacking and placing them can have unintended side effects such as a bridge or incline that can't be paid off if the player doesn't pay the full amount as well as possible corruption.

A villager's personality dictates what DIY recipes they can hand out while crafting in their home or visiting at the campsite. There are also some DIY recipes that can be handed out by any villager, specifically flower crowns and flower wreaths. [1] The chance a villager will give out a recipe specific to their personality is 95%, and the chance they'll give out a recipe obtainable from any villager is 5%. [2]

All of these DIY recipes are also obtainable from messages in a bottle.
