The Nintendo Entertainment System, Codename Home Video Computer and often shortened as NES, known as the Famicom (short for Family Computer) in Japan, was released in 1985. Although no Animal Crossing series games were released for the NES, some NES games found their way onto the GameCube Animal Crossing seventeen years later. Most are accessible through regular gameplay and Game Boy Advance connectivity, such as Animal Island or Animal Crossing E-Cards, while two, Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, both currently require a cheating device to obtain.

The Nintendo Entertainment System varies quite a bit with it's Famicom counterpart. For instance, the Nintendo Entertainment System had detachable controllers, while the Famicom's controllers were unable to be removed due to a built-in microphone function, the Famicom was smaller and much less bulky than the NES, and the colors are also changed: the Famicom has red and white coloring, while the NES has a gray and black coloring. The Nintendo Entertainment System was sold in a special pack that included Super Mario Bros., which resulted in said game being the record-holder for most copies sold worldwide, which is over 40 million. During it's lifetime, the Nintendo Entertainment System had sold over 61 million units. This console had also saved the gaming industry from the Video Game Crash of 1983.
