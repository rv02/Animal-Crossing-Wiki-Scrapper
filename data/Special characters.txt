Special characters

N/A

Special characters are animals in the game with unique features.  They range from being shopkeepers, civic servants, visitors to the player's town, event hosts, and other unique functions. Most of the special characters appear in every Animal Crossing series game, but some, such as Lottie, are unique to certain games in the franchise.  Special characters cannot be befriended like ordinary villagers, though Sable and Brewster demonstrate personality changes once talked to frequently, and Blathers, Label, and Tom Nook reveal information about their backstory when certain in-game parameters are met.  Whereas some special characters reside in the player's town, such as Wilbur or Isabelle, the special characters which come to visit, such as Pascal or Franklin, cannot ever move into the character's town, unless they are visitors who later decide to open their own shop in the town after visiting, like Gracie in New Leaf.

Off-screen characters are categorized differently than special characters.

The following is a list of all special characters in the main series (AF, AC, WW, CF, NL, NH).  Their "service" listed in table begins with the service for which they are most well known.  This table only displays the special characters physically seen in-game, i.e. it does not include special characters such as Clerk or Emcee, or mentioned characters such as the villager's Parents (Mom and Dad) or Moppina. See the table below for special characters who only appear in the spin-off games.

The following is a list of all special characters in the spin-off series (amiibo Festival, HHD, PC).  Their "service" listed in table begins with the service for which they are most well known.  This table does not include special characters referenced in the main series table who may have appeared in spin-off games.

All special characters released prior to Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer (2015) with an amiibo card can be served as clients in the game.  This includes all special characters, except Beppe, Carlo, C.J., Flick, Giovanni, and Lottie given they were released after HHD in either Pocket Camp (2017) or New Horizons (2020).

Tom Nook owns Nook Homes in this game and employs Digby, Lyle, Lottie, and the player to work for him to meet the client's needs.  Isabelle appears to request the player rebuild facilities. 

Several special characters visit the player in Pocket Camp.  Some characters, such as Chip and Katie, host events with rewards for the player while others, such as Kicks and Mable, run shops out of campers in the Market Place.

Shopkeepers found in the Market Place rotate on a daily basis.

Special characters which host events only appear for the duration of those events, with the exception of characters who have other purposes in the game, such as Isabelle.
