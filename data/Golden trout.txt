The golden trout is a river fish introduced in New Horizons. It is found in the clifftop rivers at night. It is one of the most valuable fish along with the coelacanth, dorado, great white shark, and stringfish, selling for 15,000 Bells.

Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"The golden trout is a beautifully colored fish that can only live in very clean waters. They are difficult to come across since they are found only in high mountain streams. As a side note, I find it much easier to appreciate fish that aren't such prima donnas about everything."

A real-life golden trout
The golden trout is native to several rivers in California. These small fish are famed for their beautiful bright yellow and red bodies. Sadly they are now endangered in their native range due to years of over-fishing and introduced trout species, including the rainbow trout which it hybridizes with.
