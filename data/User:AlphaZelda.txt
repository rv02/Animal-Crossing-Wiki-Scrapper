N/A

Salut! I'm AlphaZelda, and I've played almost all of the Animal Crossing games (AC, AC: WW, AC: CF, and AC: NL -- no Jap. exclusive titles). I live in North America (unfortunately), and I'm currently attending school. Aside from that, I'm a shipper! My tumblr name is "castle-all-day-erryday", and I embrace new followers with open arms. =D
