hey! i'm Hopewish (i'd prefer to be called Hope, but hey, what the heck!), one of this wiki's administrators, and a bureaucrat!

if you ever have questions about simple coding matters (like infoboxes/userboxes), and whenever you see someone break the rules/vandalize a page, contact me over at my message wall, please!

honestly I don't remember how exactly I found this wiki, I already knew that it existed/i'm pretty sure I've read stuff on it a long time ago, but I never really ever thought of editing a page until May 21st, 2020.

my first edit was of undoing something saying Raymond first originated from Pocket Camp instead of New Horizons (hah, it's like I was always destined to be a rollbacker)

and then one day I stumbled into the chat, which was probably the best decision I've ever made here on this wiki. that chat has brought me friendships, trials, and triumphs.. but most importantly, it's brought me to meet probably the most wonderful people one could ever know.

I've also met so many other wonderful people on here via the discussions boards, and I've somehow managed to weave my way into the community here, which I'll forever be thankful for.

feel free to sign my page under here! please be sure to remember to sign after you're finished typing out your message!
if you don't know how to add a signature (so I know who the message is from!), just enter in this:

and please remember to add a time stamp as well!
