When either donating to the museum or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say (with abhorrence):

"The common bluebottle is a type of swallowtail butterfly with a bright blue line running down its wings. They fly quite nimbly, it seems, and are thus quite difficult to catch. But seeing as how they've been known to slurp nutrients from MUD puddles... I simply CAN'T imagine wanting to catch one myself. What awful breath!"

The bug can be found in the butterfly room of the bug exhibit, flying during the day and resting on flowers at night.





The common bluebottle (Graphium sarpedon) is a species of swallowtail butterfly found in South and Southeast Asia. They are frequent mud puddlers and exhibit migratory behavior. In Japanese, the Common Bluebottle is known as アオスジアゲハ (Aosujiageha).
