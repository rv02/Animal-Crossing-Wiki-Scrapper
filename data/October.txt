October

N/A



October is the month in which the Animal Crossing series celebrates Halloween. (This Holiday wasn't in Wild World. ) Candy is sold throughout the month at Tom Nook's Store and Nookling Stores in preparation for Halloween (in Animal Crossing, candy starts being sold on the 16th, but is available throughout all of October on other games), whereas, in New Leaf, the Able Sisters shop will start selling Halloween masks and hats. The 31st is the only chance each year to see Jack. The grass and trees will also turn noticeably redder during this month, as it is during Fall.

Villagers born during this month fall under either the ♎ or ♏ signs.
