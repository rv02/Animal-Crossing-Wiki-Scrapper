N/A

Hullo! I am Kirkburn, you friendly local Wikia Gaming Helper!

You may be interested in adding some links from the Starter wiki's community portal. I especially recommend the links under the "Things to do heading", which are very useful quick references for visitors. Kirkburn (talk) 23:05, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

Interested in unlocking Nookington's and am wondering if anyone owning the game would help buy purchasing an item from our store.

I looking to unlock Nookington's.  Is there anywhere I can go to find someone to shop in our store to unlock this?

Shouldn't User:Wikia be listed as a bot? It would sure clear up a lot on RC to be able to hide its edits. N Segick 05:35, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

It seems as if Animal Crossing: New Leaf

Something that I noticed that has really been annoying me is the hair styles page is wrong for Animal Crossing City Folk and we can't edit it. Just wanted to point that out
