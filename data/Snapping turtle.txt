The snapping turtle is a new fish introduced in New Horizons. It is only found late at night. It is caught in the river, despite being in between the holding pond fish in the Critterpedia.

When donated to the museum, it is located in the Pond Tank, sitting on a log above water.

Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers, the curator, will say:

"The snapping turtle is a large turtle known for it's crocodile-like body and long claws. No, wait—it is better known for it's ferocious bite, which it can deliver with shocking speed for a turtle. NO, WAIT—it is BEST known for that time one chased me across a parking lot and I had to climb on top of a car."

A snapping turtle in real life
The common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is a common reptile in North America. They live in ponds, streams, and occasionally can be found in the more brackish water of estuaries. True to its name, the common snapping turtle has a powerful bite, as well as a long and highly mobile neck which allows it to reach further to bite things. They are known for their aggressive disposition when out of water, and are rumored to be able to bite off fingers and toes. These turtles are long lived, and can reach an age of over 100 years.
