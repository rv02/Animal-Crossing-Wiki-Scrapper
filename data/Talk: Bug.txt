Talk: Bug

N/A

I'm setting up a more comprehensive table of the insects here.

Diving Beetle In The Museum
I Found A Bug Called A Diving Beetle in the river

Can somebody add it to this list

and you can visit my town if you want to see it for proof GG99 16:00, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

Aren't insects more frequently called "bugs" in the game? If someone could check and see what the tab is named (it has a name in the GameCube version I know) on the start menu, that might be a good name to use. Stumpers 20:38, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

I don't think it's really important but... When I dug up a tree stump, I found a wierd crawling insect that resembled a centipede. I couldn't catch it because it was to fast. --Pokeflora 01:03, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

I caught an orchid mantis today (well, tomorrow since the store was closed). Friday, April 3rd at about noon. Anyone else find this? 69.131.51.203 21:37, 2 April 2009 (UTC)Elizabeth

I'm confused. The "Stag Beetle" on the Insect page is not on the FBP's list of insects (the template). The Miyama Stag Beetle is not on this list but is on the FBP's template. I assume it is the same insect. However, the Miyama Stag Beetle sells for 1,000 Bells (I checked), but the list says the Stag Beetle sells for 2,000 Bells. Anyone know if these two are actually the same insect, or is the Miyama Stag Beetle just not on here and the Stag Beetle needs to be added to the template? Wolven Spirit 22:54, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

The times listed here are 8am-5pm, but I caught on at 11pm. I read somewhere else that it's available from 11pm-7pm, which is what I put on the longhorn page since I caught one at that time. Can anyone else confirm this- and if so, we should change it here. Bianchiea5 03:26, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

As I was watching a Youtube video of Animal Crossing(GCN), I saw a player catch a Swallowtail Butterfly, and it resembled what a Tiger Butterfly is in ACWW and ACCF. --Pokeflora 02:07, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

Recommend a rename on the basis of some users may search "Bug" or "Bugs" in hopes of finding the Glitch page.

Suggest renaming to insect & making "Bug" or "Bugs" a disambiguation page. 13621 (talk) 00:29, August 20, 2013 (UTC)

This list of "all" bugs only includes one listing for Ladybug, even though there are two types (if you include the GCN games). How would we want to list the other to avoid confusion, since "Ladybug" was only in PG and "Spotted Ladybug" became "Ladybug"?--Shockthetoast (talk) 19:35, October 1, 2013 (UTC)

have something weird in the template of the bugs in the new leaf!!! —Preceding unsigned comment added by LuisYKW12 (talk • contribs)
