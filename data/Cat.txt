Cats (猫/貓, Neko) are a species of villager in the Animal Crossing series. They all have pointed ears, tails, and, until New Leaf, wear dress-like garments. 

There are thirty cats in the series. Four cats are special characters and the remaining twenty-six are villagers, fifteen of which are female and eleven of which are male. All but one of the four special cats are female. Five of the villagers are snooty, six are peppy, three are normal, four are lazy, two are cranky, and four are jock. There are only one sisterly cat and only one smug cat: Katt and Raymond, respectively.

Cats are the most prevalent species of villagers. Although they aren't the only species to appear as both villagers and special characters, they are notable for the fact that the two look almost identical to each other, while special dogs tend to look completely different from their villager counterparts. This may relate to how different breeds of dogs can look very different form each other, (e.g. Harvey, a cocker spaniel, and Booker, a bulldog, are both dogs.) while most breeds of cats have only coat color to difference them.

Additionally, the species is notable for having the very first villager ever created, Bob.
