The Nintendo 3DS is the successor to the Nintendo DS family. It has 3D technology without the need for glasses. The screens use a parallax barrier system. New with the 3DS is the analog control stick, gyro sensor and motion control. It is the home of the two Animal Crossing titles: New Leaf and Happy Home Designer. Animal Crossing Clock and Animal Crossing Calculator are also available as DSiWare titles.

The 3DS has a gyroscope (tilt sensor) allowing it to detect movement of the console. This gyroscope is used for some 3DS games, most prominently the built-in one known as Face Raiders. It has an analog stick called the Circle Pad. It has, like the DSi, two cameras: a regular camera atop the 3D screen, and two on the lid of the 3DS allowing for 3D pictures. The 3DS has two screens: the lower screen, which remains a regular touch screen, but the top screen has been shortened and widened, and it serves as the 3D screen for the console. There is a slider on the right side of the console allowing one to adjust the 3D depth so it can be focused. The 3D can also be turned off. The 3DS has a far more powerful processor and can display vastly more detailed graphics compared to the original DS line of consoles. The 3DS is also able to play 3D movies, on the top screen. It is backwards compatible with the Nintendo DS and DSi. It has a Virtual Console with Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (Ambassador only) games. Carrying the 3DS whilst traveling allows it to swap data with other nearby 3DS systems over local wireless. This feature is called StreetPass.

The Nintendo 3DS XL (LL in Japan) (iQue 3DS XL in China) has 90% larger screens than the original Nintendo 3DS and additionally features longer battery life. It also comes with a 4GB SD card as opposed to the previously included 2GB card. Additionally, the Start, Select, and Home buttons are completely redesigned to fit the longer screen. The bigger screen minimizes the reflection in light, and has more advanced graphics including the 3D. The shape of the 3DS XL is smoother as opposed to the rigid shape of the original model. The placing of the stylus is on the right side of the 3DS XL and is no longer on the top left side, making it easier to access.

The Nintendo 2DS is a budget model of the Nintendo 3DS. This console runs the same software as the 3DS and 3DS XL, but it does not have a hinge nor can it run 3D graphics. However, it is a lot cheaper, and is aimed at a young audience who might break a 3DS hinge and whose eyes are not developed enough to use the 3D effect safely. The console was released in October 2013 worldwide to coincide with the launch of Pokémon X and Y.
