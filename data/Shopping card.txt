The letter received with the shopping card
The letter received with the golden shopping card
The Shopping card is an item found only in City Folk. It works in the same way as a debit card, whereby Bells are withdrawn from the player's bank account instead of carrying bells.

It can only be used at GracieGrace and the Auction House, because the prices can potentially be extremely high and only 99,999 Bells can be carried at a time. 

To obtain the shopping card, the player must deposit over 10,000 Bells into the Automatic Bell Dispenser (ABD). A letter will be received with the shopping card attached the next day.

To obtain the golden card, the player must have 1,000,000 Bells deposited in the ABD. It works the same way as the basic shopping card, except it gives a 20% discount on every item in the store.

If the player loses their shopping card, they are able to go to the Automatic Bell Dispenser and select "Reissue card". They will then receive a new card in the mail. However, if a player loses their gold card, they cannot replace it.
