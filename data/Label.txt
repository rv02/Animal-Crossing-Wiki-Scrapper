“Feel free to try on anything you like!”
―  Labelle, City Folk
Label Able (ケイト Keito, ことの Kotono), also known as Labelle, is a special character in the Animal Crossing series. She serves as the store clerk for GracieGrace in City Folk, the accessories clerk at the Able Sisters store in New Leaf, and a special visitor who rewards unique clothing if the player models for her in New Horizons.

She is the younger sister of Sable and the older sister of Mabel, and left home to work as a fashion designer in the city following their parents' death, though she returns home in New Leaf. By the time of New Horizons, she is traveling and studying fashion to start her own designer clothing brand.

Label is a hedgehog with purple fur/spines. She has a cream-colored face. Her eyes are black. She wears light blue eyeshadow and darker blue eyeliner.

In City Folk, Label wears a white blouse with a black vest and pencil skirt as her work uniform. She also wears a scarf, tied like a bow, that has the same circular blue pattern seen on Gracie's shirt. In New Leaf, her outfit is relatively unchanged. The only difference is that her scarf now has an orange and white gingham pattern.

In New Horizons, Label dresses more casually. She wears a black shirt, blue denim jacket, white jeans, black shoes, white sunglasses, and the orange gingham scarf from her previous outfit. She also carries a clipboard and red pencil.

Label is extremely dedicated to her job at GracieGrace in City Folk as well her later job at Able Sisters. She is polite to players and gives good fashion tips when Gracie isn't around, but other than that her personality is not shown. Villagers inside the store will comment that she looks vaguely familiar.

In New Leaf, she has a more restrained, coy personality. Her personality becomes more affable as the player increases their patronage in her accessory shop.

In New Horizons, Label is less reserved. She is still polite, but  much friendlier to the player.

In New Leaf, Label is responsible for selling accessories in Able Sisters. She can be accessed on the right side of the store. Similarly to Mabel, Label will ask the player if they want to try on a certain accessory prior to purchase of said accessory.

If the player is a regular shopper in Able Sisters, particularly in the accessories section, she will interact with the player in a more welcoming way. After purchasing at least one accessory over 31 days, regardless of consecutive or not, she will give the player a free mannequin. Her choice of language with the player will also become of the highest politeness.

In New Horizons, Label will begin appearing on the island after the Able Sisters shop has been built. She will stand at the Resident Services plaza and ask the player to model an outfit for her that follows a specific theme. To aid the player, she will give them a free piece of clothing that she suggests should be the centerpiece of that theme. If the player returns to her wearing an outfit that fulfills her requirements, she will reward them with a single piece of clothing or an accessory from her designer brand, "Labelle", and also mail two Tailors Tickets to them the next day. If the outfit does not fit the theme, Label will comment how she has learned something new about fashion and only reward a single Tailors Ticket.

Each piece of Label's designer clothing that is acquired will be unlocked in the Able Sisters shop inventory. Tailors Tickets can be redeemed at the Able Sisters shop for a single item with a value of 3,000 bells or less per ticket. The tickets must be in the player's pockets, and will be automatically redeemed for the first items that the player purchases.

The whole episode in full can be revealed by befriending Sable and Label in City Folk, and Sable in New Leaf.

When the Able Sisters were young, their parents passed away, leaving Sable in charge of the family. Mabel was too young to help or even to remember what happened. Label had an argument with Sable and left for a new life in the city as a fashion designer, where she met Gracie, who gave her a new name, Labelle, to better reflect her life as a designer and in an attempt to start fresh. She uses this as a fashion range for herself and later her sisters.

In City Folk, Label begins to send letters to Mabel in an attempt to try and piece the family back together. This causes Mabel to be quiet and depressed when the player talks to her. An option is then presented to the player to hear the backstory of the sisters. After this, the player can then travel to the city and quiz Labelle about it, who concedes that she had done wrong and wishes to make amends with the sisters. The story concludes with Mabel wishing that Sable would talk with Labelle again.

In New Leaf, the same story can be uncovered by talking to Sable every day for ten days. Labelle now works at the Able Sisters running the accessories section of the shop, which suggests that the sisters have made friends again. Interestingly, she still keeps the designer name Labelle. At the end of the story, Sable offers the player access to the QR Machine, which is used to share patterns over the internet.

In Happy Home Designer, when the player talks to her in her home, she may say that when she was much younger she had a brief stint at the post office but left because Phyllis was difficult to work with (ironically, Phyllis kept pushing Labelle to smile and put on a "happy face"). Additional dialogue shows that she dated a horse in high-school, but saw him as a "dweeb."

In New Horizons, while Label has left the family business to pursue her own career, she remains on good terms with her sisters and has returned to using her birth name. She started traveling the world to learn more about fashion in order to start her own designer clothing brand, which she named "Labelle" after her alias. If the player becomes friends with Sable, she admits that she misses Label helping around the shop but both she and Mabel are proud to support her in pursuing her dreams.
