The Rainbowfish is a new fish introduced in New Horizons. They are uncommon, and can only be found at noon from 9am - 4pm during the months between April and October in the northern hemisphere, and November through to  April in the southern hemisphere. They have a tiny shadow size and sell for 800 bells. 

Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"The rainbowfish is a tropical fish known for its metallic colors and beautiful fins. There are over 50 different species, each unique and pleasing color. I must say, it does make me wish for feathers of a more exciting hue than "underbaked brownie."







A real-life rainbowfish


Rainbowfish are small freshwater fish found in Papua New Guinea, Australia and Madagascar. They are very popular aquarium fish due to their bright colors and friendliness. They can share their tanks with peaceful fish such as the Neon tetra and Guppy. Unfortunately many rainbowfish are now endangered due to pollution and introduction of aggressive fish such as Tilapia.
