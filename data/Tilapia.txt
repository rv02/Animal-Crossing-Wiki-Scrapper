The tilapia is a river fish introduced in New Horizons.

Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"Wherever the waters are warm, the tilapia can be found. It is a highly adaptable river fish. They mainly feed on algae, but they will also eat larvae and dead fish— or whatever fits in their mouths. I will confess that, as a growing owlet, I similarly defined food as 'anything that fits in my beak.'"





Tilapia are a family of cichlids which are found throughout Africa. They are highly adaptable animals and can be found in a variety of freshwater ecosystems; from tropical streams and rivers to huge alkaline lakes such as Lake Malawi. Some have even been found living in brackish and saltwater estuaries. Tilapia has long since been cultivated for food and is now farmed throughout the world. Sadly some species of tilapia have now become invasive in Australia, North America and Asia where they have either been deliberately or accidentally introduced to freshwater systems. Aside from food, some smaller colorful species of tilapia are kept in aquariums alongside similarly sized and tempered fish.

The species present in the game, the banded tilapia, is found throughout the southern half Africa. Unlike most cichlids it does not carry its eggs in its mouth and instead migrates in shoals to lay their eggs in sheltered pools.
