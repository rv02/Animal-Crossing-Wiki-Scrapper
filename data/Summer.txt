Summer is one of the four seasons in the Animal Crossing series. In the northern hemisphere and all games before New Horizons, the season starts June 1st and ends August 31st, or January 1st to February 28th/29th (depending on leap year) in the southern hemisphere since New Horizons. In the Animal Crossing series, this is the hottest time of the year, and this is when the trees and grass are at their greenest. This is also the ideal time for the grass in City Folk, where a new feature was introduced which allows the grass to gradually deteriorate when walked on.

Many new bugs and fish appear during this season, causing it to be the most diverse of all four.

Below is a taste of what to expect in Summer. Here is a list of the events, what happens in each, in what game and when.

Summer in Gekijōban Dōbutsu no Mori.
The weather in summer is mainly sunny with the possibility of rainfall towards the end of June/early July. The sunshine allows for the player to receive a tan when stood outside for long periods of time without holding an umbrella. 

During the end of June, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms will appear with lightning, creating sudden bursts of multi-colored flashes of light on the ground. On the 1st of July, an announcement on the bulletin board will tell villagers and the player in town that the end of the heavy rain is approaching, making way for heavier sunny periods. Through most of July its hot and dry (during this month villagers often note the heat), compared to August, which is usually humid and neighbors will complain about the "stickyness".
