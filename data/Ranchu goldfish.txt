The ranchu goldfish is a new fish introduced in New Horizons. It is found all year in the holding pond.

Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"The ranchu goldfish is a charming relative of the goldfish with a bumpy head and stout, round body. They have ordinary heads when born, but develop impressive rectangular heads after about three years. Supposedly their head shape changes depending on factors like the size of their tank... So ranchu goldfish enthusiasts aim to raise perfectly shaped specimens and work hard to achieve this. Of course, no one asks the ranchu goldfish themselves what shape they want their heads to be..."





The Ranchu goldfish is a highly regarded fancy goldfish in Japan. These fish developed abnormal tissue growth on their heads as they mature, which breeders refer to as a 'hood'. This can be several millimeters deep over much of the head such that it protrudes around the eyes, mouth and gills. Ranchus can reach between 6 and 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) in length and may come in orange, red, white, red-and-white, blue, black, black-and-white, black-and-red, natural, and chocolate coloration.
