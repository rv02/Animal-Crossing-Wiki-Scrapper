Information correct as of New Horizons



The mahi-mahi is a new fish introduced in New Horizons. Along with the tuna, blue marlin, and giant trevally, it is one of the four fish that can be caught at the pier.



Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"The mahi-mahi is an ocean fish known for its wide, somewhat-cute face. It can reach over six feet long. It is known by different names including "dolphinfish," even though it has no relation to dolphins. They live in only in warm, tropical waters...which perhaps explains the relaxed, happy look on their faces."





An angler with a real-life mahi-mahi
The name 'mahi-mahi' (Coryphaena hippurus) comes from the Hawaiian language and means 'very strong'. It is an active and inquisitive fish, often following ships and playing with floating seaweed such as Sargassum. They are common throughout the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans and can also be found in the Mediterranean Sea. As well as being fished for food, they are widely admired for its striking shape and beautiful colours.
