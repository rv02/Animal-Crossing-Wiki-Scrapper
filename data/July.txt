July

N/A



July is the seventh month of the year. July in Animal Crossing is the month before the Fireworks begin. There are certain bugs that can only be caught in July or August. Some bugs sell for more than others, and some have higher rarity than others. There are many birthdays this month, one on nearly every day.
