Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"The betta has long fins and beautiful coloring. It is a tropical fish popular in decorative aquariums. They're very territorial and will fight to complete exhaustion, so aquarists must keep them carefully. Rarely do such beauty and violence commingle outside the rowdiest of sunset-viewing parties."

The Betta will appear in the tank of small fish within the freshwater fish room, with others such as the goldfish, nibble fish, guppies and neon tetras.



Bettas (Betta splendens) are a species of fish related to gouramis from Asia. They live within ponds and slow moving rivers. Male Bettas are more colourful and have larger fins than females. The male fish will display their fins and gill covers to attract mates and scare away rivals. In the wild male fish are dark red with lashings of blue. It has been kept and bred in captivity for centuries for their beauty, with many color forms being developed. Many bettas are sadly becoming rare in the wild due to the drainage of waterways.
