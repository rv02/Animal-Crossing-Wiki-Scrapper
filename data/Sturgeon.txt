The sturgeon is a rare fish introduced in New Horizons. It can be found in the mouths of rivers at any time between September and March.

Upon donation or selecting "Tell me more about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"The sturgeon is a large and long-lived fish which has changed little in the last 300 million years. One curious behavior of theirs is leaping high out of the water and falling back in on their sides. The smacking sounds of their re-entry can be heard for up to half a mile away, likely more underwater! No one knows why they do it, but I like to think it's their impression of bread popping out of toaster! "







A real-life sturgeon.


Sturgeon are born in river estuaries and live there until the age of six. Then, they move to the saltier waters of the ocean. They are most famous as the source of caviar, with females laying over three million eggs each year. This has led to overexploitation and the threat of extinction for some species in the wild. For this reason, sturgeon are farmed for aquaculture.
