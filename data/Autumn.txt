Autumn in Wild World.
Autumn (also known as fall) is one of four seasons in the Animal Crossing series. In the northern hemisphere and all games before New Horizons, it starts on the September 1st, and ends on November 25th, or March 1st to May 25th in the southern hemisphere since New Horizons. During autumn, the trees begin to change color to an orange-brown, and the color of the grass becomes duller. In addition, insects and some rarer fish begin to disappear, making it one of the quiet seasons in the series, rivaled only by winter.

Below is a list of events found in autumn. It contains what happens in each event, what game the event happens in, and when the event happens.

*More events will be added as they happen.*
The weatherin autumn consists of a mixture of clear, sunny days, and little rain. Snow will begin to fall from the sky towards the end of November, but won't begin to settle until early December, when winter officially starts.

In September, trees will begin to lose their bright green color by turning a dull, musky green. In October, the trees will then turn a bright orange/brown color. Grass follows the same pattern as trees, by turning a dull green color in September, then a pink/orange in October, and even a shade of dull purple/gray as the months progress. Weeds also start to lose their color, and dandelions will cease to exist until next summer and/or spring. The trees will often gradually change color than rather it being an instant process.
