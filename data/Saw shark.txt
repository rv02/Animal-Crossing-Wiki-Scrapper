The saw shark (ノコギリザメ, Nokogirizame?) is a finned fish introduced in New Leaf.

In New Leaf an information board in the aquarium will list information about this fish.

"Saw sharks got their name from their long head lined with spike-like teeth much like a chain-saw blade. Sensors located below their mouths detect prey as they press their flat bodies against the seabed to search. They will sometimes swing their 'saws' wildly amid a school of fish, catching any that are struck."

Upon donation or selecting "tell me about this!", Blathers the curator will say:

"As you might expect from the name, the saw shark is a shark with a head that resembles a saw. This unusual appendage is used both to dig potential prey out of the sand and as a weapon against said prey. Given that, it seems like a more appropriate name would have been "shovel-sword shark," eh wot?"









A real-life saw shark
Saw sharks have long blade-like snouts edged with teeth, which they use to slash and disable their prey. The sharks typically feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans, depending on species. They cruise the bottom, using the saw to detect prey in mud or sand, then hit victims with side-to-side swipes of the saw, crippling them.
