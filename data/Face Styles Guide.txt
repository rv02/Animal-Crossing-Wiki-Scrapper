Face style guide in New Leaf
The player's face and hairstyle in the Animal Crossing series up until New Leaf is determined by a series of questions while on the journey to their new town. The questions are different in each game. From Wild World onwards, the player's hairstyle can be changed at Shampoodle for 3,000 Bells. In New Leaf, the player's eye color can also be changed at Shampoodle. The player's face style is unchangeable. In Happy Home Designer, Pocket Camp, and New Horizons the face style is determined manually.

The appearance of the player's face and eyes in New Leaf is dependent on how they answer three of Rover's questions on the train when first starting the game. This chart will shows the outcomes of the different prompts.

At the start of City Folk, Rover asks the player the questions while on the bus.

In Wild World, Kapp'n asks the questions when driving the player to their new town in the taxi.

He will ask other questions, such as why the player is moving there (this determines their house's location), their name, and the current time.

When the game starts, Rover will walk over to the player on the train, ask them for their name and for the correct time, and also several questions.

The player must answer the last question with 'Just a little...', or else the game randomizes the player's face and disregards their selected options.

After this, the player exits the train and has the first glimpse of their character's face. If they don't like it, they can simply turn the console off and back on to retry.
